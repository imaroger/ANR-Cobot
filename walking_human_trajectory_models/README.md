# walking_human_trajectory_models
Two human-like locomotion models are impletemented in this repository : a model based on clothoid curves and a control optimal model.

To run the control optimal model, you need to install this version of the crocoddyl library : https://github.com/imaroger/crocoddyl/tree/mybranch.

To build the C++ code, this repository must be placed in a catkin workspace.
